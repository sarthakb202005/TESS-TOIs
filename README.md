#TOI-700d
TOI-700 d is a dense, rocky, near-Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the red dwarf TOI-700. 
It is located roughly 101.4 light-years (31.1 pc) away from Earth in the constellation of Dorado and is the outermost of 4 confirmed exoplanets around its star. 
The exoplanet is the first Earth-sized exoplanet in the habitable zone discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).
TOI-700 d orbits its star at a distance of 0.161 AU (24,100,000 km; 15,000,000 mi) from its host star with an orbital period of roughly 37.4 days and has a radius of around 1.19 times that of Earth. It has been estimated that the planet receives about 88% the energy that the Earth receives from the Sun.
